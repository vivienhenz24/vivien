The perceived value of a college degree has decreased in recent years. Here's a reason: some companies will now recruit college students as early as their sophomore year. I'm looking at you, investment banks.

Most jobs have little to do with what you learn in college [1], so you're wasting your time if you're going there to prepare yourself for a real job (shocker). I don't like wasting my time, but I like going to college. (explain it's responsibility)




Am I wrong? Ask yourself: would have I done anything differently if I didn't have to worry about getting a job until after I was done with school? You have your answer.




[1] If you disagree with me and already have some real work experience, did you really need to go to college to complete the tasks you're assigned at work or could you have learned the skills that you need elsewhere, or even on the job?

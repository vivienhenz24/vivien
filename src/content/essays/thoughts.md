The perceived value of a college degree has decreased in recent years. Here's a reason: some companies will now recruit college students as early as their sophomore year. I'm looking at you, investment banks [1].


Most jobs have little to do with what you learn in college, so you're wasting your time if you're going there to prepare yourself for a real job (shocker). I don't like wasting my time, but I like going to college. Why do I like going to college?


I think that college is valuable because you can spend your time whichever way you’d like, and don’t have to worry about bringing food to your own plate. So if you don’t have to worry about food, then you choose to spend your time on things you like or are curious to know about more. And if you choose to work on things you’re curious about,in general you tend to like that work more than if you didn't like it, and you end up doing a better job.




Except now we have early recruiting. And early recruiting is competitive. So if you’re a freshman arriving on campus, you realize that if you want food on your plate after you graduate, you have to worry about it now. You don’t ask is this interesting, but will it bring food to my plate?




Do you want to know why we haven't had another Facebook at Harvard? Because during his sophomore spring the Mark Zuckerberg of 2018 was chasing a Goldman Sachs internship instead of building Facebook. Early recruitment completely changed your would-be college experience and you didn’t even realize.


Am I wrong? Ask yourself: would have I done anything differently if I didn't have to worry about getting a job until after I was done with school? You have your answer.

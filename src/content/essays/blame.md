The perceived value of a college degree has decreased in recent years. Here's the reason: some companies will now recruit college students as early as their sophomore year. I'm looking at you, investment banks [1]. 

Before I explain myself, let me tell you why I think college is valuable. Here it is: at college, you get to learn things. 

Alright yes that’s valuable but you don’t need to attend college to learn things. Is there anything else? 

At college you get to learn things, *and* you don’t need to worry about putting food on your plate [2]. 

Now we’re talking.

Having virtually no responsibilities means that you have complete freedom over how you choose to spend your time, and therefore what you choose to work on. And when people have the choice, they tend to spend their time working on things they enjoy. Similarly, students tend to choose to spend their time learning about things they’re interested in.

And that is valuable. Not only for students, who get to learn about themselves by satisfying their intellectual curiosity, but also for you. How? When people work on things they like, they tend to work harder on them. So, if you get a bunch of smart students to work hard on things that they enjoy, it’s a recipe for them to create things that are valuable to society.

Here’s one thing college is not valuable for: preparing students for a real job. Most jobs have little to do with what you learn in college. As a matter of fact, I worked a real job this summer, and I can tell you I didn’t need college to learn the skills required to be competent there.

Now here’s the part where investment banks come in. They ruined everything. An entry-level job at Goldman Sachs pays $120,000 a year. Now imagine you’re a freshman and you just stepped foot on campus, you know that Goldman starts recruiting in twelve months. So if you’re going to want food on your plate after you graduate, you better start worrying about it now. 

Now you’re making decisions based on what will increase your likelihood of getting that job, and what do companies look for in candidates, those that are the most prepared. And didn’t we just say that college was useless at preparing students for real jobs…

Do you want to know why we haven't had another Facebook at Harvard? Because during his sophomore spring the Mark Zuckerberg of 2018 was chasing a Goldman Sachs internship instead of building Facebook. 

Seriously, early recruitment has completely reshaped your college experience, and you didn’t even realize it.

Do you think I’m wrong? Ask yourself this: would I have done things the same way if I didn't have to worry about getting a job until *after* I was done with school? You have your answer.

[1] And consulting firms, PE firms, quant trading firms, big tech companies etc etc… (it just didn't sound as good if I included everyone) 

[2] I really don’t want to sound reductive here, of course there are so many students that face incredible personal and financial hardships while attending college, and do have to worry about bringing food to their own plate. But brother, we go to Harvard, 96% of students come from families in the top 50% of earners.

The perceived value of a college degree has decreased in recent years. Here's a reason: some companies will now recruit college students as early as their sophomore year. I'm looking at you, investment banks [1].


Quick observation that we're saving for later: most jobs have little to do with what you learn in college, so it’s pretty safe to argue that college is useless at preparing students for real-life jobs.


No, instead I think that going to college is valuable because (a) you get to learn things while you (b) don't have to worry about putting food on your own plate [2] which means that (c) you have complete freedom over how you spend your time. And because when they have the choice, people tend to spend their time on things they enjoy, college students will tend to spend their time learning about things that are interesting to them.


Not only is this good for students, because they learn more about themselves by exploring their interests, it’s also great for creating valuable things. Students that work on things they like will tend to work harder on them, and when you have smart students working hard on things, they tend to create valuable things.


Except it’s not like that anymore. Now when freshmen step foot onto campus, they quickly realize that damn, if they want eat after they graduate, they're going to have to worry about it right now. So they don’t make decisions based on their intellectual curiosity, they make decisions based on what will bring food on their plate. THey play defense from the get go, they protect their GPAs at all cost and basically shape their curriculum around getting that job. Wait didn’t we say college was useless at preparing students for real-life jobs?

Do you want to know why we haven't had another Facebook at Harvard? Because during his sophomore spring the Mark Zuckerberg of 2018 was chasing a Goldman Sachs internship instead of building Facebook. Seriously, early recruitment completely changed your *would-be* college experience, and you didn't even realize it.

Do you think I’m wrong? Ask yourself this: would I have done things the same way if I didn't have to worry about getting a job until after I was done with school? You have your answer.

[1] And consulting firms, PE firms, quant trading firms, big tech companies etc etc… (it just didn't sound as good if I included everyone)


[2] I really don’t want to sound reductive here, of course there are so many students that face incredible personal and financial hardships while attending college, and do have to worry about bringing food to their own plate. But brother, we go to Harvard, 96% of students come from families in the top 50% of earners.

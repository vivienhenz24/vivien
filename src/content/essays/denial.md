How did we let Adolf Hitler rise to power? Through denial.

Today, we see Adolf Hitler as a ruthless authoritarian. A murderer, who combined charisma and manipulation so effectively that he held an entire nation in fear. But in the 1930s, we didn't see him this way.

For one, we didn't fear Adolf Hitler. And how could we? If you watched one of his speeches, you saw a short man with a silly haircut and a sillier mustache, who jabbed the air with his finger and flailed as if overcome by some fit. The show distracted you from his message. American journalists at the time would “burst out laughing [...] and refused to take him seriously” [1]. In fact, his style of delivery was so strange we even coined a word for it: *Hitlerian*.

We didn't think Adolf Hitler wanted to start a war. In 1935 he renamed the Reich Ministry of Defense to the Reich Ministry of War, and still we convinced ourselves he had peaceful intentions. If Neville Chamberlain [2] bet on appeasement, it was because he couldn’t imagine Adolf Hitler would start a war. When he annexed Austria in 1938, and then demanded the Sudetenland, we thought he only wanted to restore German pride. So, we did nothing.

We didn’t think Adolf Hitler would try to control what people learned. But in 1933, the book burnings made it clear: knowledge itself had to bow to the Nazi vision. Students tossed volumes into bonfires, celebrating the destruction of “un-German” ideas. Universities, once spaces for debate and discovery, became tools for indoctrination. And what did we say? American papers brushed it off. They called the students’ actions “silly,” “ineffective,” “infantile.” The New Yorker even joked about Nazi “extra-curricular activities” [3]. Once again, we laughed.

We didn't think Hitler would exterminate the Jewish people. Even though it was clear that Jews had no place in his vision of Germany. Even when in a 1933 speech to the Reichstag (Germany's parliament), Adolf Hitler stressed the need to root out "left-wing ideology" and "alien influences," with Jews being explicitly tied to both. And still we convinced ourselves he wouldn't actually follow through on his threats. So we did nothing.

If only we had realized what was going on, we might have stood up to Adolf Hitler and prevented the atrocities that followed. We could have been on the right side of history. [4]

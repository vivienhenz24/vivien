When I was in high school, I started reading George Orwell's 1984 at 2pm on a Saturday, and by Sunday 4am I was done. I devoured that book.

This had never happened to me before with books. Firstly because my attention span was already fried from scrolling through short-form video content on my phone, (thank you tiktok) and secondly because I used to be a committed athlete, which meant that pulling all-nighters were strictly forbidden.

Back then I thought that what compelled me to read this book with such ardor was it's plot. I mean, it felt like I was spectating theatre unfolding within pages that didn't have a pause button. But now I know it wasn't because of that. It was because of Orwwell's writing. 

The story his book wanted to tell just flowed freely, you could tell there was no friction between what he wanted to say and his words. And you'll know if you studied physics that when there's no friction, it's pretty hard to stop anything. 

George Orwell famously came up with six rules to abide by when writing:

    1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
    2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
    3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
    4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
    5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
    6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

Now I'm not here to tell you why you should write like that. I'm here to tell you that these rules go beyond the realm of writing. Because what he is saying in 1 and 5 is "stay true to yourself, people dont like a copycat" and in 2,3,4 is be simple. Because being simple requires more effort than beign complicated, becuase you have to think hard about what you're going to put on that paper if you want to do it in the least amount of time, people instantly recognize concentrated effort over complciated. Just the way people prefer arcuh concentrated soup over watered down bruh. 


So you have to keep things simple, which is hard work, and you have to be yourself, which is also hard work. So really here, you have to work hard on the things that you do.

THIS IS STILL A DRAFT

When I was a teenager, I starting reading George Orwell's 1984 at 6pm on a Monday, and I was done by 4am on the tuesday. I devoured that book.

This had never happened to me before with books. Firstly because my attention span was already fried so theres no way id be able to focus on something for so long, thank you tiktok, and secondly because i was a very good boy and pulling an all-nighter was a no no.

Back then I thought that what ccompelled me to read like that was that the plot was just so good. That i was watching some show and couldnt wait to see what happened next.

But now I know it wasn't because of that. It was Orwwell's writing. it was so fucking good, instead of trying to push electrons down they were flowing freely, there was no friction between what he wanted to see and his words

    1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
    2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
    3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
    4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
    5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
    6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.


This is very famous. and im not here to tell you why you should write like that, im here to tell you everything you DO should abide to that.
becasue what he is saying in 1 and 5 is "stay true to yourself, people dont like a copycat" and in 2,3,4 is be simple. Because being simple requires more effort than beign complicated, becuase you have to think hard about what you're going to put on that paper if you want to do it in the least amount of time, people instantly recognize concentrated effort over complciated. Just the way people prefer arcuh concentrated soup over watered down bruh. 


So you have to keep things simple, which is hard work, and you have to be yourself, which is also hard work. So really here, you have to work hard on the things that you do.
